## Introduction

Image classification has been a concept of wise research in interest in the field of Computer Science
around. It is quite trivial for the human brain but a seemingly impossible task for the computer , but
with the right concepts it can be pulled off. We experiment with this activity by training a residual
neural network with the CIFAR-10 dataset.
It has been observed from past research that it makes sense to state that deeper the convolutional
neural network the better the training which correlates to higher accuracy. However, it has been
noticed from our implementation of the ResNet-18 neural network and with a limit on the parameter
count we are able to achieve up to 94.94% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image dataset .
